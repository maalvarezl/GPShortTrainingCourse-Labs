    "We will look at modelling the data using coregionalization approaches described in this morning's lecture. We introduced these approaches through the Kronecker product. To indicate we want to construct a covariance function of this type in GPy we've overloaded the `**` operator. Stricly speaking this operator means to the power of (like `^` in MATLAB). But for covariance functions we've used it to indicate a tensor product. The linear models of coregionalization we introduced in the lecture were all based on combining a matrix with a standard covariance function. We can think of the matrix as a particular type of covariance function, whose elements are referenced using the event indices. I.e. $k(0, 0)$ references the first row and column of the coregionalization matrix. $k(1, 0)$ references the second row and first column of the coregionalization matrix. Under this set up, we want to build a covariance where the first column from the features (the years) is passed to a covariance function, and the second column from the features (the event number) is passed to the coregionalisation matrix. Let's start by trying a intrinsic coregionalisation model (sometimes known as multitask Gaussian processes). Let's start by checking the help for the `coregionalize` covariance."
